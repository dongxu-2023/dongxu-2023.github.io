Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Michigan State University. My research employs causal inference strategies to study the effect of local labor market changes on education choice, and the influence of education on migration pattern. In specific, my job market paper studies how import competition from China in recent three decades affected college going behavior for U.S. population. Another current project aims to evaluate how levying vocational education millage in Michigan affects offered programs and high school students' participation in career and technical education.

Before coming to Michigan State University, I received a dual Bachelor's degree in Economics and Mathematics from China University of Political Science and Law in 2017. I then earned a Master degree in Economics from Tufts University in 2019. In addition to work, I enjoy biking and playing badminton.

I will be on the 2024-25 job market and available for interviews. I am mainly interested in industry positions. Please feel free to reach me at <dongxu2@msu.edu>.
